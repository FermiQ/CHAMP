In the late changes:
all the fortran modules generated by the compiler (".mod" files) are put in the "fortran_modules" folder
(note that, also, all the fortran objects generated by the compiler (".o" files) are put in the "fortran_objects" folder).

This requires a compiler option that may change from one compiler to the other.
It is coded in the "makefile.inc" file, in the variable "MODCMD".
For "gfortran", it is "-J".
If this is different for your compiler, add a line in your personalized section of the "makefile.inc" file.
Mind also the "INCMOD" variable ("-I" for gfortran).
