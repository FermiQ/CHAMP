There are only two executables. For the serial version, type
>make clean
>make
to create the executable "champ.exe".

For the MPI version, type
>make clean
>make mpi
to create the executable "champ_mpi.exe".

>champ.exe -m vmc_mov1 <input >output
>champ.exe -m dmc_mov1 <input >output

For the MPI version, vmc and dmc calculations are launched by typing
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m vmc_mov1_mpi -i input >output
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi1 -i input >output
