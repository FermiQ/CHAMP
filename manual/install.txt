CHAMP

Compilation:
-----------

In the directory qmc

1) Setup environment variables for compilation.

Edit the file "makefile.inc" and look if you have to change the paths, compilers, compilers' options, etc...


2) Compilation.

There are only two executables. For the serial version, type
>make clean
>make
to create the executable "champ.exe".

For the MPI version, type
>make clean
>make mpi
to create the executable "champ_mpi.exe".


Execution:
---------

For the serial version, vmc or dmc calculations are launched by typing, for one-electron moves,

>champ.exe -m vmc_mov1 <input >output
>champ.exe -m dmc_mov1 <input >output

and, for all-electron moves,

>champ.exe -m vmc <input >output
>champ.exe -m dmc <input >output


For the MPI version, vmc calculations are launched by typing

>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m vmc_mov1_mpi -i input >output
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m vmc_mov1 -i input >output

and dmc calculations by
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi1 -i input >output (default)
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi2 -i input >output
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi3 -i input >output

Notice that for the MPI version, the input file has to be given in the command line as an option '-i input'.
