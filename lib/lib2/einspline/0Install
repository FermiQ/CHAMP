This is version einspline-0.8.9

Installation:

1) ./configure_my
   For more configuration options:
   ./configure --help
   I then edit Makefile and change the FFLAGS line (line 128) to
   FFLAGS = -zero -save -extend_source -w -r8 -O3 -pad -mtune=core2 -march=core2 -xT
   on 64-bit machines, but this is not necessary.
2) make
3) make install
4) Go to lib and do a
   rm *.so*
   If we do not do that we can still link CHAMP but when executing we get the error msg:
   /home/cyrus/champ/qmc/champ_mpi.exe: error while loading shared libraries: libeinspline.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
   I think if we use -static when linking, then it is not necessary to delete the *.so* files.

Documentation at http://einspline.sourceforge.net/doc.shtml
says
To take maximum advantage of SSE instructions, configure with "--enable-sse"
It works on the dft cluster, but does not seem to change execution speed appreciably.
