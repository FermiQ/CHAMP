Important Notes regarding python file included in this folder.
--------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage of scripts:
--------------------------------------------------------------
./g0x_log_2_xmvb.py GAUSSIAN.LOG
Produces bfi and xmi files for the preparation of XMVB input files based on the SCF, NBO and LMO orbitals.



./g0x_log_2_champ.py GAUSSIAN.LOG
Produces CHAMP input files based on the SCF orbitals. Currently produces RHF/ROHF wave functions with Gaussian basis sets and optional pseudo-potentials.



# Current Limitations:
--------------------------------------------------------------
* In write_champ_v1.py:

The functions analytical_basis() does not work at all.

The function grid_basis() needs testing.

The function mixed_analytical_grid_basis() is limited to Spherical Harmonic functions up to 6H and the order is fixed to Gaussian(R) ordering.


* In Gaussian_read_v1.py:

The function read_basis_set() does not handle SP or L type functions.

The function read_pseudo-potentials() cannot handle SO-Coefficients.


* In general_tools_v1.py: 

The functions periodic_table_lookup() and atomic_number_from_element_symbol() use the current IUPAC symbol as seen on wikipedia and webelements web sites.

The function compute_contracted_GTO_at_point() does not handle SP functions or any function higher than H.

The function compute_contracted_STO_at_point() does not handle SP functions or any function higher than H. NEED TO TEST THIS FUNCTION


* The files g0x_log_2_xmvb.py and g0x_log_2_champ.py produce only RHF or ROHF wave functions.

* Currently only Gaussian type orbital wave functions are produced by g0x_log_2_champ.py.


# Known Errors:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slight difference between basis.* and pseudopot.* files produced by the script when compared to those produced from gamess2qmc. 
Exact impact of these differences is currently unknown.

---> Please add them here when Beta testing has commenced. <-------------


# Resolved Issues:
