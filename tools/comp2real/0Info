Devrim Guclu's program for converting complex orbital determinants
to real orbital determinants, written for Cyrus Umrigar.
Works for both 2d and 3d systems.
In 2d, the l value is irrelevant, since l=|m|.

To run type
comp2real <input_file_name>
(Do not use input redirection and leave out subscript .in)>
e.g.
comp2real n2l0s0

Better to use script "run", e.g.,
../../run *.in
will run all inputs.
