To compile:
	Set the Fortran compiler in src/Makefile and type 'make'

To run:
	From the example/ directory, type 'make'

The input file has three values:
(grid factor) (separate Laplacian or gradient approximation) (test against plane waves)

A grid factor of 1.0 is natural grid spacing.  Smaller is a coarser grid.  Larger is a finer grid.

0 approximates the wave function only.
1 approximates the wave function and the Laplacian.
2 approximates the wave function, the Laplacian and the gradient.

.t. calculates the root mean square difference of the approximation and the plane waves at 100 random points for each orbital
(NOTE: this test has not been corrected to use the separately approximated Laplacian and gradient and will yield identical values no matter what the previous variable is set to)
.f. does not skips the test
