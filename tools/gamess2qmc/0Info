Run gamess2qmc on GAMESS output to create CHAMP input (vmc.inp file).
Best to run gamess2qmc by running either
champ/tools/csf2csf/run_csf2csf
or
champ/tools/csf2csf/run_csf2csf_excited
on GAMESS output. Creates (vmc.inp2 file in addition to vmc.inp file).

Previously we were creating the basis files on a grid from running gamess2qmc on a GAMESS output.
That basis using the gaussian expansion of the Gauss-Slater functions and so it differs a bit from the actual
GS basis.  Frank has now written basis_grid.py which is run on a GAMESS input and outputs the actual GS
functions on the same grid.
