To compile and link serial and parallel versions of CHAMP in champ/qmc/champ.exe and champ/qmc/champ_mpi.exe:
1) cd champ/lib/lib2/einspline
   Check that configure_my is appropriate (using icc or gcc)
   install
2) cd champ/qmc
   make
3) make clean
   make mpi

Note that you presently have to do a "make clean" between a "make" and a "make mpi" or vice versa.
I should get rid of step 1), but for some reason configure_my does not run correctly if I run
it by cd'ing there from a Makefile.
