CHAMP

Compilation:
-----------

In the directory 'champ' 

1) Setup environment variables for compilation.

Edit the file "makefile.inc" and look if you have to change the paths, compilers, compilers' options, etc...


2) Compilation.

a) Compiling the libraries:

>cd lib
>cd make

b) Compiling the qmc code:

>cd qmc

There are only two executables. For the serial version, type
>make clean
>make
to create the executable "champ.exe".

For the MPI version, type
>make clean
>make mpi
to create the executable "champ_mpi.exe".

Do not mix mpi and serial objects! If you are unsure, do a 'make clean'.

There is also a debug version:
>make clean
>make debug

Note that if you add or delete files, or modify the module dependancies, you need to generate a new Makefile by:
>make make

Execution:
---------

For the serial version, vmc or dmc calculations are launched by typing, for one-electron moves,

>champ.exe -m vmc_mov1 <input >output
>champ.exe -m dmc_mov1 <input >output

and, for all-electron moves,

>champ.exe -m vmc <input >output
>champ.exe -m dmc <input >output


For the MPI version, vmc calculations are launched by typing

>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m vmc_mov1_mpi -i input >output
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m vmc_mov1 -i input >output

and dmc calculations by
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi1 -i input >output (default)
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi2 -i input >output
>mpirun -np 2 champ_mpi.exe -m dmc_mov1_mpi3 -i input >output

Notice that for the MPI version, the input file has to be given in the command line as an option '-i input'.
